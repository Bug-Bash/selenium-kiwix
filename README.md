Selenium Conference 2014 Kiwix Bug Bash
---------------------------------------
The Selenium Conference 2014 is hosting a Bug Bash http://bugbash.in/kiwix-at-seconf This github repository is the home for people who are participating in the Bug Bash; the project may live on after the conference and/or be combined with the master project at http://sourceforge.net/projects/kiwix/

The aims of the Bug Bash extend beyond 'finding bugs', we are keen to encourage and foster collaborative work where we experiment with creating automated test suites for one or more of the kiwix applications. The conference has attracted several hundred passionate individuals; many have significant experience with the Selenium test automation framework. We also have several software testing gurus who are particpating in the Bug Bash and available to collaborate with the test automation to enhance the potency of the automated tests.

Participants can work individually and in groups. 

Suggested approaches include: 
   * Implementing automated tests for one or more of the kiwix applications, incluing the kiwix web server (called kiwix-serve). These tests can be written using the framework of your choice. For instance here are some possible frameworks for the Android app: Appium, Selendroid, Calabash, Robotium, etc. For the web app, how about Selenium (given the title of the conference :) )
   * Reviewing and enhancing current open bugs from the sourceforge project http://sourceforge.net/p/kiwix/bugs/ so they are easier to understand and fix
   * Providing translations, especially for incompletely translated locales http://sourceforge.net/p/kiwix/kiwix/ci/master/tree/android/res/

What do you need?
At least one of the kiwix applications. 
At least one zim file. Here's one source, http://download.kiwix.org/zim/wikipedia/ people at the conference can also get them in the E Square room.
